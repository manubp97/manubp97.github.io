user_description: Hi! I am a Data Engineer from Spain. Since I discovered Data Science, programming has become my true passion. My main interest is distributed data processing and ETL for Machine Learning applications. In the near future I want to create online content for sharing my passion for Data Science, improving my communication skills and showing off ðŸ˜Ž. In my free time, I enjoy practising Muay Thai and learning about economy and liberalism.
